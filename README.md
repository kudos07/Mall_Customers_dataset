# 🛍 Mall Customer Segmentation (Clustering Project)

This project applies **unsupervised clustering** to the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset to uncover distinct shopper groups. Businesses can leverage these segments for **targeted marketing, loyalty programs, and personalized promotions**.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
- 200 customers with the following features:  
  - `CustomerID`  
  - `Gender`  
  - `Age`  
  - `Annual Income (k$)`  
  - `Spending Score (1–100)`  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
- **Preprocessing**
  - Dropped `CustomerID`
  - Encoded `Gender` into numeric
  - Standardized numeric features (`Age`, `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`)
- **Clustering**
  - Applied **KMeans** across values of K
  - Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to guide selection
  - Chose **K=5** for a balance of interpretability and separation
- **Outputs**
  - `cluster_assignments.csv` – each customer’s cluster ID
  - `cluster_profiles.csv` – per-cluster averages of age, income, spend
  - `elbow.png`, `silhouette.png`, `pca_scatter.png` – diagnostics & visualization
  - `clustering_report.md` – summary of results
